You will use a different Oracle Integration Cloud environment for this tutorial. 

The instructor will provide the connection details.

You can download the instructions from here: [SaaS_EBS_Integration_HOL_ED_v3.pdf](./pdf/SaaS_EBS_Integration_HOL_ED_v3.pdf)

This tutorial will show you how you can put an integration in place between two applications. Once the integration is in place, an activity in one application can trigger a business event that will start the integration and perform an activity in another application. There is no need to manually trigger the integration with a testing tool.
